# Tweet-Stock-Relationship
The goal of this project is to determine whether positive sentiment expressed in stock market-related tweets has a measurable influence on a company's stock price. I'm interested in exploring the relationship between public sentiment and market performance, as investors often make decisions based on the information and sentiment they receive through social media and news platforms.

To investigate this, I analyzed a dataset of tweets mentioning major companies (such as Apple and Amazon), performed sentiment analysis to classify the tweets, and then compared the results against the companiesâ€™ stock prices over time. My hypothesis is that a higher volume of positive sentiment correlates with a rise in stock price.
